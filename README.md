# NUCLEUS

## Requirements

### Bochs

`Bochs` is needed in order to run the kernel. As different operating systems pack `Bochs` software differently, the proper version for `nucleus` is stored inside `resources/bochs`.

Current `Bochs` version is `2.6.9` build with the following parameters:

* `--with-sdl2`
* `--enable-plugins`
* `--enable-gdb-stub`
* `--enable-disasm`
* `--enable-show-ips`
* `--enable-x86-debugger`
* `--enable-repeat-speedups`
